# LAB2

This lab implements a simple API using FastAPI for managing information about people. It includes functionality to add new people and retrieve a list of existing people.

 Functions:
This lab was done to update a dictionary using Post to add person to it by use of a function that
 checks the validity of the incoming data, ensuring that all fields (name, occupation, address) are provided and not blank. If the data is valid, it adds the new person to the existing data list and returns a success response. If any field is blank, it returns a failure response with an appropriate error message.

Another requirment was that you were supposed to be able to see the newly updated dictionary by use of a get request to retrieve a list of all existing people in the system. It returns the list of existing people as a JSON response. The function is written to allow users to retrieve a list of existing people in the system. It provides a way to view all the data stored in the system.

Purpose:
This code was written as a demonstration of building a simple API using FastAPI using both get and post requests.

Favorite Pokémon:
My favorite Pokémon is Chimchar. I like Chimchar because of its fiery personality,loyalty and overwhelming strength along with its evolution into the powerful Infernape. Chimchar also holds sentimental value as it was my starter Pokémon in one of my favorite Pokémon games Black and white which was a classic for Gen 4 of Pokemon.
